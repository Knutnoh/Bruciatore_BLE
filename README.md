# Bruciatore_BLE Controller

This project provides a Python script for interacting with the VEVOR diesel air heater, All-in-One model, via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The code has been developed through Bluetooth data sniffing between the heater and the manufacturer's "AirHeaterBLE" app.

## Description

The VEVOR diesel air heater is designed for use in cars, campers, trucks, and RVs. This script allows you to control the heater using a BLE-compatible device, such as a Raspberry Pi or a computer with a Bluetooth adapter.

## Features

- Bluetooth Low Energy connection with the VEVOR Diesel Air Heater device.
- Sending specific commands (cmd1-19) to control various heater functionalities.
- Monitoring and displaying information received from the heater, such as temperature, ignition status, power, and more.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Arch Linux: sudo pacman -S base-devel cmake libevdev libconfig systemd-libs glib2
- Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt install build-essential cmake pkg-config libevdev-dev libudev-dev libconfig++-dev libglib2.0-dev
- Bluepy Library: `pip install bluepy`

## Usage

1. Ensure your Bluetooth device is enabled.
2. Run the Python script.
3. Follow the instructions to input manual commands or let the script automatically send the `cmd1` command at regular intervals.

## Supported Commands

Available Commands:
- `P0`: Turn heater OFF.
- `P1`: Turn heater ON.
- `T8-T36`: Set temperature (8-36Â°C).
- `L1-L10`: Set power level (1-10).
- `exit`: Exit program.
